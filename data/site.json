    "text": "MLOps-oriented Software Engineer with hands-on experience in AI-assisted development workflows and operating AI services in production. I focus on reliable deployment of LLM/RAG services on Kubernetes, automated ML lifecycles (data → training → validation → deployment → monitoring), and observability with Prometheus and Grafana. I think in architectures (scalability, security, integration) and work in a test-driven way with clear quality and release gates."
